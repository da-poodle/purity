# Purity

A Horn Clause only library for Prolog

# Introduction

Prolog is a mixed bag of pure logic and hacks involving the cut operator that has been meshed together to create a programing language that is easy to use and flexible enough to create any program on reasonable terms.

This issue is that the cut operator logic takes away the pure nature of Prolog, and so this library is to remove the cut altogether and allow programs to be written using pure horn clause logic only.

This is achived through a series of discoveries and techniques borrowed from libraries like the reif collection of predicates. There are a few differences with programing using Purity and the default Prolog lanagues constructs, so I have included some concepts that will need to be understood, then a library reference and some sample programs.

> NOTE: This library has been built and designed for SWI-Prolog, however there is nothing vendor specific in the library and it should be easily portable. I am going to port to Scryer program soon in the future.
